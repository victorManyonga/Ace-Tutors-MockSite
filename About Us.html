<h2>About US
<p> ACE Tutoring is a young company with talented tutors. We have big dreams for the future with the focus on helping others.
 We strive not only to support our students but also our community and those in need.
To do this, 5P Tutoring organizes quarterly events
 – “Give backs” – where the ACE Tutoring team will collaborate and participate to give back to the local community. 
Be it free one on one tutor sessions or giving a tutor session to a class. 
We believe in giving back and sharing knowledge.</p>

<p> The Covid-19 pandemic has created a huge hurdle for learners across the globe.
 Social distancing is the new way of living and will continue for several months to come.
 The technology of today allows society and business to continue to function.
 It also provides our students the opportunities to continue with their developmental growth and learning.
 Online learning is no longer a skeptical or unattainable concept but rather a reality. 
ace Tutoring has made this a focus and encourages all online learning.
 For this reason, we have online tutors ready, on stand-by to support the learners of South Africa with their needs.

Where we operate </p>

We can assist you anywhere – with our online tutor sessions.

Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 we are currently suspending all face to face sessions until further notice.</p>
